# Local setup — personal hardened claw fork

This doc captures the operational plumbing layered on top of the upstream
`claw` binary for the personal hardened build (this fork). It is **not** part
of upstream `ultraworkers/claw-code` — these scripts and units reference
machine-specific paths and are conventions for this fork only.

For the *what and why* of the hardened permission policy itself, see the
patches under `patches/` and the merged PRs (#1, #2).

## What's in scope

Three artifacts live outside the repo, in the user's `$HOME`:

| Artifact | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `~/.local/bin/cl` | Friction-killed wrapper around `claw`. Sets `OPENAI_BASE_URL` + `OPENAI_API_KEY` for the cross-machine LMStudio backend; the default model lives in `~/.claw/settings.json` so it applies uniformly to `claw`, `cl`, and any subcommand. |
| `~/.claw/settings.json` | User-level claw config. Pins the default model (currently `openai/qwen/qwen3.5-9b`). Overridden per-invocation by `--model` and per-project by `<project>/.claw.json`. |
| `~/.local/bin/cl-web` | Launches `ttyd` wrapping `cl`, exposing the REPL at `http://localhost:7682`. |
| `~/.config/systemd/user/cl-web.service` | User systemd unit that keeps `cl-web` alive across shell exits and reboots (with linger enabled). |

A symlink `~/.local/bin/claw -> /mnt/d/src/claw-code/rust/target/release/claw`
also exists so the raw binary is available on `PATH` for cases where the
LMStudio defaults aren't wanted (e.g. talking to the Anthropic API).

## Prerequisites

- WSL2 with systemd enabled (`/etc/wsl.conf` containing `[boot]\nsystemd=true`).
- `~/.local/bin` on `$PATH`.
- The release `claw` binary built at `/mnt/d/src/claw-code/rust/target/release/claw` (`cargo build --release --workspace` from `rust/`).
- `ttyd` installed system-wide (`sudo apt install -y ttyd`).
- LMStudio reachable at the IP/port baked into the wrapper (currently
  `http://100.100.0.10:1234/v1` over Nebula). Adjust the wrapper if the
  endpoint changes.

## Files

### `~/.claw/settings.json`

```json
{
  "model": "openai/qwen/qwen3.5-9b"
}
```

Resolved by claw's `ConfigLoader` as a User-source config. Overridden by
project-level `.claw.json` and per-invocation `--model`. With this in
place, the wrapper no longer needs to inject `--model`.

### `~/.local/bin/cl`

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Friction-killed claw wrapper. Sets cross-machine LMStudio env defaults.
# Default model is in ~/.claw/settings.json (picked up uniformly by claw,
# cl, and any subcommand). Override --model from the CLI to pick a
# different model. To bypass entirely, call `claw` (the symlink to the raw
# binary) with OPENAI_BASE_URL unset.

set -euo pipefail

exec env \
    OPENAI_BASE_URL="${OPENAI_BASE_URL:-http://100.100.0.10:1234/v1}" \
    OPENAI_API_KEY="${OPENAI_API_KEY:-unused}" \
    /mnt/d/src/claw-code/rust/target/release/claw "$@"
```

Make it executable: `chmod +x ~/.local/bin/cl`.

### `~/.local/bin/cl-web`

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Serve `cl` (claw REPL with LMStudio defaults) via ttyd on
# 0.0.0.0:7682. Each browser connection spawns a fresh REPL session.
#
# Bind notes:
# - Do NOT use `-i lo` on WSL2 — claw's `lo` interface has TWO addresses
#   (127.0.0.1 + 10.255.255.254, the WSL bridge). ttyd's `-i lo` picks
#   the bridge address, which breaks Windows's localhost forwarding
#   (Windows only forwards to processes bound on 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0).
#   Bind to 0.0.0.0 (omit -i) so localhost forwarding works.
# - Port 7681 (ttyd default) may already be bound on this WSL2 host by an
#   unrelated ttyd wrapping `login`. We use 7682 to avoid the conflict.
#
# Open from Windows browser: http://localhost:7682
# Open from inside WSL2:     http://127.0.0.1:7682

set -euo pipefail

exec ttyd \
    -p 7682 \
    -W \
    -O \
    -t titleFixed=claw \
    -t fontSize=14 \
    /home/prcdslnc13/.local/bin/cl
```

Make it executable: `chmod +x ~/.local/bin/cl-web`.

### `~/.config/systemd/user/cl-web.service`

```ini
[Unit]
Description=ttyd-wrapped claw REPL (cl-web) — web access on http://localhost:7682
After=network.target
Documentation=man:ttyd(1)

[Service]
Type=exec
# Important: cwd must be the project root so claw's config loader picks up
# the hardened /mnt/d/src/claw-code/.claw.json. Without this, claw falls
# back to the runtime hardcoded default (DangerFullAccess) — same gotcha
# fixed in PR #2.
WorkingDirectory=/mnt/d/src/claw-code
ExecStart=/home/prcdslnc13/.local/bin/cl-web
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5s
Environment=HOME=/home/prcdslnc13

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

## Bring-up sequence

```bash
# 1. Reload user systemd so the new unit is visible
systemctl --user daemon-reload

# 2. Enable + start the service
systemctl --user enable --now cl-web.service

# 3. Enable linger so the service survives logout / WSL2 restart
sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"

# 4. Verify
systemctl --user status cl-web
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w 'HTTP %{http_code}\n' http://127.0.0.1:7682/
```

Then open `http://localhost:7682` in any Windows browser. The claw REPL
should boot and show:

```
Permissions      read-only
```

If you see `danger-full-access`, the cwd-precedence gotcha is back —
check `WorkingDirectory` in the unit file and the contents of
`/mnt/d/src/claw-code/.claw.json` (must include the `permissions` block,
not just `aliases`).

## Day-to-day commands

```bash
# Health
systemctl --user status cl-web

# Restart (e.g. after rebuilding the claw binary)
systemctl --user restart cl-web

# Logs (tail)
journalctl --user -u cl-web -f

# Stop / disable
systemctl --user stop cl-web
systemctl --user disable cl-web
```

## Cross-device access via Nebula

To reach the REPL from another device on the Nebula tailnet, enable WSL2
mirrored networking on the Windows host. Add `%USERPROFILE%\.wslconfig`:

```ini
[wsl2]
networkingMode=mirrored
```

Requires Windows 11 22H2+. Apply with `wsl --shutdown` from PowerShell and
relaunch. After that, any port bound inside WSL2 on `0.0.0.0` (which
ttyd is) becomes reachable on every host interface, including the Nebula
overlay address (`100.100.0.4:7682` in this setup). Localhost forwarding
is auto-disabled in this mode — instead WSL ports show up directly on
Windows interfaces.

## Known limitations / not-done

- **No auth.** ttyd is unauthenticated. Fine for localhost-only; required if
  ever exposed beyond the local box. Add via `-c user:pass` in `cl-web`.
  Especially relevant once mirrored networking is on and the REPL is
  reachable on the Nebula overlay.
- **Hardcoded LMStudio endpoint.** The `cl` wrapper bakes
  `http://100.100.0.10:1234/v1`. Editing the script is the override path.
  A future improvement would read the endpoint from a config file.
